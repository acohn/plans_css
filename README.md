This repo contains HTTPS-enabled versions of custom stylesheets for
[GrinnellPlans](https://www.grinnellplans.com/), a social networking site for
alumni of Grinnell College. 

Plans has long allowed users to create custom CSS stylesheets, allowing people
to personalize their experience on the site. Many stylesheets have been created
and passed around for that purpose. The site recently made using HTTPS
mandatory, which requires users to host their stylesheets somewhere that also
supports HTTPS. This repository exists for that purpose.

Everything in this repository is also available at
